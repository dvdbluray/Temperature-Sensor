# Temperature-Sensor
Sensor temperature realized with Arduino.

A Arduino TMP36 sensor is implemented alongside resistences and transitors. It measures the external temperature and a different LED will show up, according to the temperature. Celsius grades are displayed in a LCD screen. Also, as soon as the temperature varies a specific range, a Piezo produces rumor.
